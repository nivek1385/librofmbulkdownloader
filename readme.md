Currently, the script will download all files in series. Some of the files will have the extension doubled (e.g., .zip.zip) and some won't. Will need to resolve that eventually. Some other future features are listed at the top of the script. It expects a session key cookie in .sessionkey in the current directory. This can be obtained using devtools in the browser where it is named _store_session. Script also requires my library.sh for functions and logging (e.g., it uses my standard outdebug, outerror, etc. functions for output rather than straight echo or printf).
