Currently, the script will download all files in series. Some of the files will have the extension doubled (e.g., .zip.zip) and some won't. Will need to resolve that eventually. Some other future features are listed in the features_and_bugs.txt file. It expects a session key cookie in .sessionkey in the current directory. This can be obtained using devtools in the browser where it is named _store_session. Script also requires my library.sh for functions and logging (e.g., it uses my standard outdebug, outerror, etc. functions for output rather than straight echo or printf).

Using the specific book download option (via --isbn or -i), will attempt to download 5 files since libro.fm breaks the books into series of files. The current version of that option doesn't do any analysis for the number of files that exist for the book. Some of the other options are currently placeholders for future use and have no actual effect on execution.
