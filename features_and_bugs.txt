Future Features:
-Request specific file formats only
-Request certain books only
-Overwrite or not options
-Update file name with titles\authors\narrators

Known Bugs:
-Sometimes the file extension is doubled (e.g., .zip.zip)
-Requesting certain books attempts to download 5 files rather than detecting how many files actually exist. It also assumes zip files unless the format is also specified prior on the commandline (order matters).
-Requesting specific file format only works if also specifying specific books and only if the format is specified prior to the ISBN on the commandline (order matters).
