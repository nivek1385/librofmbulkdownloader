Future Features:
-Request specific file formats only
-Request certain books only
-Overwrite or not options
-Update file name with titles\authors\narrators

Known Bugs:
-Sometimes the file extension is doubled (e.g., .zip.zip)
-Requesting certain books attempts to download 5 files rather than detecting how many files actually exist. It assumes zip for the format unless otherwise specified on the command line via the format option.
-Requesting specific file format only works if also specifying a specific book.
